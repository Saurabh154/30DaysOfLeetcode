You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively. Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

//another apporach bhi hai 2 pointer wala baad me review karenge tb

//code : 
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        for (int j = 0, i = m; j<n; j++){
            nums1[i] = nums2[j];
            i++;
        }
        sort(nums1.begin(),nums1.end());
    }
};
